            <h3>world class vehicle</h3>
            <p>The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo
                concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes a redesigned
                exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes, a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the
                retractable wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car on a
                central fin and ultimately on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin spoiler, more
                refined
                side skirts, larger air intakes on the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the bonnet for
                improved radiator cooling and vents on the front wheel arches to cool the brakes.</p>
