            <h1> <span class="og-color">bugatti</span> world</h1>
            <h3>world class vehicle</h3>
            <p>The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo
                concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes a redesigned
                exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes, a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the
                retractable wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car on a
                central fin and ultimately on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin spoiler, more
                refined
                side skirts, larger air intakes on the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the bonnet for
                improved radiator cooling and vents on the front wheel arches to cool the brakes.</p>

            <p>The Skyview option was developed in accordance with the attributes that characterize the CHIRON. The
                symbolic
                horseshoe grill, and the distinctive C-bar on the side, still define it as unmistakably BUGATTI, as do
                its
                pronounced lines and generous surfaces. From inside, the glass roof enables a view into another
                dimension,
                flooding the cockpit with natural light.</p>

                <p>It generates a new feeling of speed and space, turning a drive in a BUGATTI with Skyview option into
                    an
                    incomparable, three-dimensional experience. The two glass elements are installed on either side of
                    the
                    central fin, which protrudes from the CHIRON's carbon fiber body and stretches fluidly toward the
                    signature line which defines the car's unmistakable profile.</p>

                <p>To reach its unprecedented levels of performance, the CHIRON effortlessly merges its captivating
                    beauty with sleek, muscular efficiency; a spectacular reinterpretation of the BUGATTI design DNA.
                    The intelligent air intake management significantly improves aerodynamics and enhances the cooling
